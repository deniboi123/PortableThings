# PortableThings
(copied from ReadMe.TXT)

PortableThings is a folder that contains some things that can be run on a USB drive.
# UNZIP THIS FOLDER or it wont work.
You must unzip or else none of the games will work.

## How to put on USB drive?:
All you have to do is drag the folder onto a USB drive and thats it. Some of the files need
Admin privileges. But none of the games do.
 
## What is 'Extensions'?
Since the chrome web store is probably blocked, there are many extensions in a folder. However 
you cannot just execute a file and put them in your extensions. Heres how to install extensions

1. Go onto chrome and open 'chrome://extensions' through the URL bar.
2. At the top, there is a developer mode switch. Turn that on
3. Click on Load Unpacked and go to the extenion that you want to install.
4. Boom! Should be installed.

## Hint: You can also use your own extensions. Maybe to bypass a client-side firewall (lol who uses dat)
